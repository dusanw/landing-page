Well, it took me full day and little gaming with flexbox, but got it somehow similar. It's not pixel perfect...there are still think which didn't settle in my brain (i.e. shirnk grow flex on image etc.). Honestly noe peaking elsewhere, all from what I learned. 
Started by your instructions from the top to bottom, HTML first and then css. Splited in four sections and a footer. Used mostly flexbox to align and center everything. Wanted to use <figure> and <figcaption> in random information section, but couldn't get it done properly. I had to use <br> to split text from icons at the random informaton section.
I have no previous experince in coding, but I'm eagre to learn and create. So if anyone will have look at this, spare a little wisdom and critics to my work, so I can get better in this, please. 

Thank you all for this great Odin Project, it's exactly what I needed.
